excercise 1:
You are given a DataFrame that includes the names and ranks of people.
You need to take a rank as input and output the corresponding name column from the DataFrame as a Series.
Note that the rank is an integer, so you need to convert the user input to an integer.

import pandas as pd
a = {
   'name': ['James', 'Billy', 'Bob', 'Amy', 'Tom', 'Harry'],
   'rank': [4, 1, 3, 5, 2, 6]
}

b = pd.DataFrame(a, index=a['name'])
print(b)

c = int(input())
print(b[b['rank']==c]['name'])

Output:

name  rank
James  James     4
Billy  Billy     1
Bob      Bob     3
Amy      Amy     5
Tom      Tom     2
Harry  Harry     6
4
James    James
Name: name, dtype: object
